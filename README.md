# Conway's *Game of Life* with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A Jupyter notebook implementation of Conway's *Game of Life* with a CNN, using Python 3.5 with NumPy and Keras. Please be aware that GitHub's Notebook Viewer doesn't render any of the SVG diagrams nor does it process the LaTeX code correctly. Therefore, I have included an [HTML rendering](https://rhaver.github.io/Conway's%20Game%20of%20Life%20with%20CNN.html).

<!--
Another rendered preview of the Jupyter notebook, but which doesn't put the output cells in nice scrollable blocks:
